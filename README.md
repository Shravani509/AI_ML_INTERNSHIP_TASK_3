# AI_ML_INTERNSHIP_TASK_3

### âœ… Steps Involved in Analysis
### Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values and encoded categorical features using one-hot encoding.
### Model Building
Trained a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.
### Prediction & Evaluation
Generated predictions and evaluated performance using standard metrics.
### ðŸ“Š Model Performance Summary
Intercept: -149,634.07
Coefficients:
Features like guestroom, airconditioning, and bathrooms have large positive coefficients.
One feature (likely an unfurnished status) has a significant negative effect.
RÂ² Score: 0.66
Indicates the model explains 66% of the variance in house prices.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): â‚¹7.16 lakh
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Very high
### Signifies the presence of outliers or large errors in some predictions.
### ðŸ“ˆ Residual Diagnostics
A Q-Q Plot of residuals shows significant deviation from the normal distribution.
residual vs. predicted plot to further check homoscedasticity.
### Residual have constant variance
